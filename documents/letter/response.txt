We have fixed this in the abstract.

These citations have been added to the introduction, along with a result from the SPY survey, searching for SN Ia progenitors, which identified two additional LMWDs in close binaries with unknown companions.

We have added a sentence explaining the importance of finding individual NS-LMWD systems in paragraph 2 in the introduction and a sentence explaining the importance of understanding the companion mass distribution to LMWDs in paragraph 4.


>
>- Section 2. Why using a logarithmic prior for sigma(WD)? 

We choose a logarithmic prior for sigma(WD) since it is scale invariant. We have added this to the text. 


>Why fixing sigma(NS) to 0.05Msun when sigma(WD) has a much wider range? Is it because the NS mass distribution peaks at ~1.35Msun with almost no tail towards lower and higher masses? 

We wanted to build a simplistic model, with few parameters, therefore we set the NS distribution without allowing it to vary. From Kiziltan et al. (2013) and Smedley et al. (2014) it appears that NSs with WD companions may have a slightly higher mass tail, therefore we set the NS mass distribution higher than the canonical value of 1.35 Msun. 



>According to the text, sigma(WD) ranges from 0.02-2Msun. However, in Table 1 I see sigma(WD) proportional to sigma^(-1), where 0.02 
>- Table 1. The prior of mu(WD) is written as U(0.2,1), but should not it be U(0.2,1.4)?

The prior on sigma(WD) should be U(0.2,2.0) and on mu(WD), 0.02 < mu < 1.0. Both the text and table have been fixed to reflect this. For the flexibility of our model, we allow sigma(WD) to vary greatly. We still truncate the mass distribution at [0.2,1.44], but we do not allow the center of the Gaussian to go above 1.0 Msun.

The distribution in Figure 1 was drawn from a Gaussian with mu(WD)=0.7 Msun and sigma(WD) = 0.2. We tested this by drawing other random samples; the bimodal distribution is due to the randomness of drawing 100 WD samples. In other randomly drawn samples, this distribution appears as a single Gaussian.

Based on your suggestion, we have added a fourth test where we derive the resulting WD mass distribution of companions to the post-common envelope binary sample from SDSS. The description of this test is included in Section 3.4, and the results are included in Figure 4.

There is a distinct possibility that the companion WDs could contribute to the luminosity of the LMWD primaries in these systems. However, Gianninas et al. (2014) point out that because the systems are all single-lined spectra, they expect the companion’s “contribution to the observed spectra to be on the order of a few percent at most.” In investigating this possibility though, we found a bigger issue: For two of the three eclipsing systems, the spectroscopic mass measurements are in agreement with the expectation from the eclipse measurement. For the third system, NLTT 11748, there is a significant discrepancy. Gianninas et al. (2014) contribute this difference to the “high log g problem”, a manifestation of the problems with using 1-D WD atmospheric models. They suggest that only the spectroscopic masses of the seven WDs with temperatures below roughly 9500 K will be affected. We add a note of caution in the text to indicate there may be some unknown uncertainties in these mass measurements.

We expect that all these systems are detached due to the lack of emission lines in the spectra as would be expected from an accretion disk. The text has been updated to specify that the companion masses may be more massive due to previous mass transfer phases.

While most of these systems almost certainly have a combined mass less than 1.4 Msun, many of the combined masses of these systems are still ~1Msun. They may therefore evolve into underluminous supernova. We have included some discussion of this in Section 4.2.

Systems with higher mf values are more likely to have NS companions through Equation 1. We added a note about this in the text.

>Report from Referee 2:

>I provide here comments only on the statistical methodology of this manuscript, not on any scientific aspects. I have not checked the equations (8)-(15) in detail. 
>
>The procedure in section 2 focuses on the question raised in the Introduction: "1. Can the population as a whole be modeled using a simple description of the companion masses?" The setup of the likelihood seems reasonable. The normal mixture model for white dwarf and neutron star secondaries is also reasonable. The inference that the secondary WDs have similar mass distributions as primary WDs is unsurprising and adds confidence that the calculation is reasonable. I have two comments:
>
>A. Bayes' rule is only needed if significant priors are introduced. Are equations (7) and (19)-(20) relevant prior distributions? If so, please label them accordingly. Indeed, the authors state in 4.2/par2 that the "results are independent of astrophysical expectations as they do not include informative priors on ..."; but the entire point of the Bayesian approach is to introduce meaningful priors. Since the authors seek the MAP solution, I suspect the calculation is equivalent to a constrained maximum likelihood calculation (e.g. http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1008669208700 http://faculty.washington.edu/rons/cmlinf/cmlinf.html). There is no difficulty in using an MCMC approach, and the results are unchanged, but the authors should clarify that the calculation can be viewed from either perspective. Fortunately the authors do not emphasize `Bayesian' in the title, abstract or conclusions.

The prior in equation 7 comes from the fact that the inclination angle is random. One of the advantages to this sample is that there is (nearly) no observational bias on the inclination angle, therefore this prior is appropriate. The priors on our NS model, listed in Equations 19-20, are reasonable based on NS mass measurements derived elsewhere, in Kiziltan et al. (2013) and Smedley et al. (2014). 

We agree that there is no difference between our method and a maximum likelihood calculation. We have added a sentence clarifying this in the first paragraph of Section 2.



>
>B. Concerning the statement in 4.2 "Our distribution is significantly wider ....[physical explanation]. Couldn't this be a statistical effect: Wouldn't the posterior distribution appear wider just because the sample is small and the spread is thus poorly constrained? This can be checked with simulations of different sample sizes.
